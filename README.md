XLex
====

An XML language which defines a Lexical  Analyzer  for converting any document into XML.  Once in XML compilation into other document types can be done using XSLT transformations.

The XLex language is still under development and defined in XML Schema. This project is a proof of concept Java implementation of this language which is still under development. As of now this implementation is not functional and is only intended for developers.
